Dragon of necrotic

**Appearance**
A mighty dragon

**Personality**
At first scary just to joke a bit with any new faces he sees but very chat full and considerate of other creatures feelings when talking about subjects. If asked for help he will do the best of his ability to help, but not with everything only if it at his resting place. 
Can sense faith.  

**Lore**
One of the four ancient dragons, he began began his life by ruining the world, spreading his necrotic flames and killing. The energy of spreading death soon grew boring for him, so he ventured to a place away from all life to mediate of his life choices.  When he came back from his meditation there was a lot of un trust and fights against him, and he didn't fight back. Slowly trust came back to him and civilisation forgot all about his previous killings. Now he slumbers in the mountains teaching wisdom to passer-by.  

**Death**
if ever killed, his body would turn to topaz.
