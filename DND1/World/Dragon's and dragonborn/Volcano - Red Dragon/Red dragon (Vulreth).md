Dragon of fire

**Appearance**
It is a red dragon that has plenty of burn holes in it wing, many black burn marks over its body. His eyes sunken down from the thought of dying slowly by the finger. scales being darker on the tips and more fragile then what was expected for an ancient dragon.

**Personality**
A calm and sorrowful voice for the dragon. It thinks of how strong and mighty it previously was and now quietly waits for people to find him and give him a death worth dying for. When he feels like his life is in danger he wakes fell alive again and is ready for a fight and gaining a burst of energy. 
Sad when just talking. Standing proud and mighty when an honourable death is coming for him "I have burned through the centuries. Let me burn no more.".

**Lore**
When the seal was used and shattered and landed on the red ancient dragon. for many centuries he was the strongest one of the dragons. Instead of finding a place to live he created volcanos from a jungle. As time passed he grew more week from the power of the finger. He chooses to slumber, hoping to gain his powers back. Now he has become very weak and awaits a honourable death. 

**Death**
when he dies he turns to a hot burning stone. a hole in the chest region of the dragon opens up showing the finger of god of burning will inside it. 
If the party fails the dragon shows pity. "Come back later and fight me when you are stronger. I wont show mercy next time"
