**Where dragons come from** 
The dragons were created as the first life of the world. The world was raw, the ocean to heavy, the wind to powerful, the earth to unstable and the fire to hot. The four ancient dragons were created to bring stability to the dead landscape.
* The steel dragon to concur and calm the waves, the steel dragon was the one to make the world calm from to strong forces. (the reason why the world is not to windy or strong waved)
* The red dragon to quell and stop the spreading of fire in the world, the red dragon was the one to bring life. (the reason why life exists)
* The topaz dragon for raising mountains an continents for the world, the one to make sure nothing lives forever. (the reason why death and aging exists)
* The moonstone dragon to make a connection for the world and arcane. the one to bring magic to life. (the reason why magic exists)
