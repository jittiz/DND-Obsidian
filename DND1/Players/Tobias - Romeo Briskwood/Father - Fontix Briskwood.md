My father, Fontix Briskwood, is an infamous bard who loved spreading rumours and lies about himself. Before he arrived in Widdlewad, the town was quiet. But with him around, there was never a day when something wasn't happening. I always listened to his stories and believed everything he said. I still believe in him and look up to him, wanting to be just like himâ€”a hero.
One of his rumours in Widdlewad was that he had a romantic relationship with one of the four dragons of the realms, before leaving them for his future wife. 

My mother, Jona Briskwood, had settled down in Widdlewad with Fontix Briskwood and had a child, Romeo. When Fontix told her about wanting to go out on an adventure, Jona was disappointed, but knew that keeping him in Widdlewad would be a shame. She said her goodbyes and told Romeo about how he had to go out to save the world from a Fizban and their evil plan. When Romeo left, she was alone and awaiting both of them at home.
