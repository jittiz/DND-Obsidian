The only noticeable thing that happens that day is some footprints of a big animal. the footprints are from a bear. He askes the question if the party has killed a human / humanoid. 
* Day 3: starts early as the last day but rain starts pouring down heavily. the party can choose to rest the rain away or go during the rain. resting makes it take 10 days instead, going during the rain makes the road muddy and a wheel pops off. making it take longer to get there. He askes the party how they felt when killing. 
* Day 4: soon at the next place you can get a nice rest there. although some bears approached from the forest. 2 bears. combat begins. do what you were payed to do he says while staying at the carriage. After the fight he is impressed but that's why you were hired. Where is home for you?
* Day 5: That day the party gets to the next town [[Plesawisks]]. the party arrives there early or late depending on what happened in the rain. the party can choose to explore the town a bit.

[[Captain Rowan]]. and he encourages the party to do the same if they want. 
* Day 6: now well rested in beds the party can continue out of the town not going to [[Dun Khardruk - main city|Dun Khardruk]]. soon coming to a snowy place, just a bit of snow here. Rowan offers them the spare winter coats that he has with him. After some time some fog appears, and a little more time passes and a fallen tree is in the way. "Hells that is a bit annoying". And ambush, the party gets ambushed by some bandits. "Oh that's why, clever trick". after the encounter when the party stops at the resting point he askes if anyone has someone to return to, a lover, family member or friend.
* Day 7: still fog that day but just a bit easier to see, nothing really happens that day. later on the fog fully clears up and the party is close to being at later they see a house in the distance, Something even Rowan is confused about.
