**Its piece**
* The piece of the god of life. The god of life's finger landed in a remote place in the world. After many years, it was discovered and a church was built for it, not well known, but the people who went to the church lived longer than expected. Eventually, the priest summoned the people who knew of the finger to come. A ritual that was meant to make everyone who came immortal turned the believers into stone. Still living but stuck as stone. It lets the party use Revivify once before having to wait a long time before it can do it again.
