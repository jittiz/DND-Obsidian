 
 The palm is the artifact that binds the finger pieces together. Its power is to help guide the party to find the closest finger piece, and when they are all together, it removes immortality from the BBEG.

**The look**
It is a hand where every finger of the hand is a different colour depending on the god's finger that was used. The palm of the artifact is a black pearl metallic colour, made from the core of a star. It's unnecessarily heavy for its look and has a compass in the middle of the palm that uses magic to point to the closest finger piece.
