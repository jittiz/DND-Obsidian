**Its piece**
* The piece of the god of dreams. The god of dreams finger is tied to the dream realm. The only way to get there is the remote island (Name, it is bottom left on the map). The island does not exist and is an illusion from the dream god's finger. Sleeping on the island's top, where beds are placed, wakes the party up in a different realm. The dream realm where they have to find the piece. Anything can happen in the dream realm, and when anyone wishes or hopes for something, the DM rolls in secret to see if it happens. When the finger is retrieved, they snap back to reality. The ground shakes, and the island slowly disappears. It gives detect magic as a cantrip to the person who holds it.
