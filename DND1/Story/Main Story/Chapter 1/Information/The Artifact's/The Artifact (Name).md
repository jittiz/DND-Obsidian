Forged from the god to seal the god of ending. now it is shattered across the world and needs to be brought back together to have a chance to stop the BBEG.

**It's Lore**
The god of ending was the biggest threat to everything, even the gods themself. To not let this be the end of the world the other gods created an artifact to seal away the god of ending. The power being so strong that it could seal other gods they chose to spit it in to (Number) of pieces and scatter them across the continent.

**where the pieces are**
The pieces are strong with magical powers. In their location, where they rest the world warps around it.

* The piece of the god of burning will. Stuck in the ancient red dragon that at first gave unmatched power, but now has slowly been killing it. The fire in the finger burned too strong and slowly scarred the body and soul. No longer can he fly, and wants death in an honourable duel. Gives the person who holds the piece one free reroll on anything once per long rest.

* The piece of the god of life. The god of life's finger landed in a remote place in the world. After many years, it was discovered and a church was built for it, not well known, but the people who went to the church lived longer than expected. Eventually, the priest summoned the people who knew of the finger to come. A ritual that was meant to make everyone who came immortal turned the believers into stone. Still living but stuck as stone. It lets the party use Revivify once before having to wait a long time before it can do it again.

* The piece of the god of dreams. The god of dreams finger is tied to the dream realm. The only way to get there is the remote island (Name, it is bottom left on the map). The island does not exist and is an illusion from the dream god's finger. Sleeping on the island's top, where beds are placed, wakes the party up in a different realm. The dream realm where they have to find the piece. Anything can happen in the dream realm, and when anyone wishes or hopes for something, the DM rolls in secret to see if it happens. When the finger is retrieved, they snap back to reality. The ground shakes, and the island slowly disappears. It gives detect magic as a cantrip to the person who holds it.

* The piece of the god of stories. A mouth with a story scroll for a tongue will appear close to the party at some point in the adventure. Looking into it, there is a door inside the mouth. going to the party gets sent to a story world, and has the objective to complete the story as it has been told to them in the beginning of the campaign. The story of (story name). when achieving the end the finger comes to the party. The finger gains advantage in history checks.

* The god of wind and storms. It lays at the center of the island cluster's storm. The party has to figure out a way to get into the eye of the storm and get the finger. Let the party find a solution to getting the finger. The finger lets the holder fly with their movement speed.

* The palm is the artifact that binds the finger pieces together. Its power is to help guide the party to find the closest finger piece, and when they are all together, it removes immortality from the BBEG. 

**The pieces together**
* The palm shows nothing when the party gets it. 
* When the party gets the first finger the party is shown the artifact falling down to the world. Show roughly where the all the pieces fell.
* The second finger show the god creating the palm with the material from a stars core.
* The third finger shows there hands only and the gods ripping of there fingers one by one. 
* The fourth finger shows the gods sealing away something with the artifact, a lost god? 
* The fifth finger shows all of the gods that sealed away the other god. It is shown that the god of life, god of burning will, god of dream, god of stories and the god of storms all lost one of there fingers to stop the lost god.

**When it is used**
When the artifact is fully assembled and the party sees the BBEG. They activate it, and a flash happens, the BBEG bleeds from his nose. Stillness is in the room, and the power of oblivion stops. The BBEG's immortality is severed from his god.

**The look**
It is a hand where every finger of the hand is a different colour depending on the god's finger that was used. The palm of the artifact is a black pearl metallic colour, made from the core of a star. It's unnecessarily heavy for its look and has a compass in the middle of the palm that uses magic to point to the closest finger piece.
