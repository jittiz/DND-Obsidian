Lore of the god

**Its piece** 
* The piece of the god of burning will. Stuck in the ancient red dragon that at first gave unmatched power, but now has slowly been killing it. The fire in the finger burned too strong and slowly scarred the body and soul. No longer can he fly, and wants death in an honourable duel. Gives the person who holds the piece one free reroll on anything once per long rest.
