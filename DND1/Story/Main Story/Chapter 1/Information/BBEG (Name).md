He is not evil nor good, his goal is something inevitable.

The BBEG is a cleric for a lost god, The god of ending. no one know of his existence except for the ancient dragons. 

**Personality**
how dose he see the party

**Immortality**
The cleric is immortal and cant die. The immortality comes from the powers of the lost god, the god of ending. He can not feel pain, bleed, age or die. He can not be banished to a different realm and permanently stays in this world because of his god. Nothing in this world will be able to kill him unless the artifact is activated and severs his connection to immortality. 

**His reason for being chosen**
He dose not know his past. Life has gone for to long and wants it to end but not before finishing what he started. He wants to die with everything else in this world. He thinks he is the only one awake in a dream world that is refusing to die. He wants to feel pain again but is unable.

**How he destroys the world slowly**
The powers of the Oblivion. It is not visible and can only be detected when sensing it with arcane. it is visible when really close to the BBEG and is described as a grey smoke that slowly moves away from its center. The world slowly gets consumed by this power. people will slowly lose there memory, forgetting there name not reacting to things, colour disappearing. it spreads slowly but eventually will engulf everything in the world.
